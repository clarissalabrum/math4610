# Homework 6

## Task 1

[Click here for the results of running the function on the 4 root finding routines.](https://github.com/clarissalabrum/math4610/blob/master/homework/homework6/task1.md)

## Task 2

[Click here to go to the test results and a comparison of the results](https://github.com/clarissalabrum/math4610/blob/master/homework/homework6/task2.md)

## Task 3

I changed the hybrid method so that when fa, fb, and fc are all positive or negative the interval will be made shorter. I changed it like this because the first c value is very close to the root we want. [Here are the changes made.](https://github.com/clarissalabrum/math4610/blob/master/homework/homework6/task3.md)

## Task 4

For the secant method I needed to do the same that I did in the hybrid method. I added a check so if the two ends of the interval are both positive or negative the interval will be shortened until one end has a different sign. [Here are the changes to the Secant Method.](https://github.com/clarissalabrum/math4610/blob/master/homework/homework6/task4.md)
