# Task 3

Below are the steps taken to do a computational convergence analysis on Newton's method.

![Newton Convergence](https://github.com/clarissalabrum/math4610/blob/master/homework/Homework5/Newtons.png)

The equation in oranage is the regression line for the log(ek+1)-log(ek) relation. The slope is 3.1348 which would be the rate of convergence. It was expected to be a value close to 2.
The variation in the observed and expected might be due to the function used to solve the problem or maybe that it convereged too quickly that the analysis did not have enough points to 
give a good approximation.
