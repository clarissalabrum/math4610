# Homework 2

## Task 1 

Choosing Java, I created a java program program [JustABunny.java](https://github.com/clarissalabrum/math4610/blob/master/homework/homework2/JustABunny/src/JustABunny.java) in response to the "It's only a bunny". 

To execute the code the following commands need to be used.

    javac JustABunny.java
    java JustABunny
    
Compilation: 

    public class JustABunny {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("It's only a bunny");
        System.out.println("*BAD THINGS HAPPEN*");
        System.out.println("Well, it's always the same, I always tell them, " +
                "do they listen to me?");
      }
    }

## Task 2
