# Homework 7

## Task 1

[Back Substution](https://github.com/clarissalabrum/math4610/blob/master/homework/Homework7/Task1/backSubstitutionsSM.md)

Here is the test of the code:

    What's the size of the matrix?
    5
     -1.00  0.00  1.00  2.00  3.00
      0.00  1.00  2.00  3.00  4.00
      0.00  0.00  3.00  4.00  5.00
      0.00  0.00  0.00  5.00  6.00
      0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  7.00
    Solution:
    -0.45714285714285713
    0.22857142857142854
    0.05714285714285716
    0.02857142857142858
    0.14285714285714285

## Task 5

[Row Echelon Form](https://github.com/clarissalabrum/math4610/blob/master/homework/Homework7/Task5/rowEchelon.md)

## Task 6 

I found some conditions that need to be satisfied but I am sure that the list is probably longer. The first I found cooresponds to the size of the equations. The system needs to have an equal number of equations to unknowns. [https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/systems-of-linear-equations.html](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/math/systems-of-linear-equations.html). Another condition that I found is that the leading row need to have zeros below it, this is where pivoting can help the system to try to transform it into a working system.
