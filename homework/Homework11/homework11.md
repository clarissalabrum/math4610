## Task 6

I found a list on this site [https://www.openmp.org/about/whos-using-openmp/](https://www.openmp.org/about/whos-using-openmp/) of different companies and use openMP and how they use it. OpenMP allows you to accomplish a lot of things, making programs more efficent. OpenMP allows you to create threads and then manage them creating parallelized loops, make threads synchronized and divide the work amoung the threads as needed. Parallel program allows programs to accomplish things that normal comutting can not.
